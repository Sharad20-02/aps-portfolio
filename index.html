          The domain I have chosen to focus for my portfolio is Spotify, one
          of the biggest music streaming platforms. With Spotify, it‚Äôs easy to
          find the right music or podcast for every moment ‚Äì on our phone, our
          computer, our tablet and more. There are millions of tracks and
          episodes on Spotify. So whether we are behind the wheel, working out,
          partying or relaxing, the right music or podcast is always at our
          fingertips. We can Choose what we want to listen to, or let Spotify
          surprise us. We can also browse through the collections of friends,
          artists, and celebrities, or create a radio station and just sit back.

        <h2>Why Spotify?</h2>

      Spotify is a service in existence which is found to be everywhere. Many products try
      to claim that they are ‚Äúcross platform,‚Äù which usually translates to
      mean that there are Android and iOS apps, and maybe a web app. Spotify
      as a service breaks conventional boundaries, allowing you to engage
      with your music beyond any app. Just take a look at this screenshot of
      of the feature <span class="italic-bold">Spotify Connect</span>:

      Spotify‚Äôs scope isn‚Äôt just playing music; it‚Äôs about discovery,
      curation, and social interaction too. From a quick look at the app‚Äôs
      landing screen, it‚Äôs pretty easy to see that there are lots of themed
      playlists available. Although a bit more hidden, some of the best and
      most used browsing methods on Spotify are playlists that are
      customized for each user. Perhaps the biggest crowd favorite is
      Discover Weekly. Discover Weekly is a unique playlist generated for
      each user based on their listening habits that is updated every Monday
      morning. That means that every Monday I, and many other Spotify fans,
      get to experience music we haven‚Äôt heard yet, specifically geared to
      our listening preferences.
